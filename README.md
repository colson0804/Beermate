# Beermate Personal Beer Recommender

Building a Ruby on Rails application based on a beer recommender I built in Matlab for a machine learning course. The current approach generates a linear classifier based on scientific values (ABV, IBU, SRM, and OG) we gathered for each beer. Our system recognizes user preferences for these values and then recommends a new beer for the user to try.

I hope to explore different approaches to this problem, including some that analyze the language used to describe beer (which may be a better indicator of preference than scientific values anyway). I'd also like to include some kind of a social feature (see what your friends are drinking) and the ability for users to write reviews of beers they've tried.
